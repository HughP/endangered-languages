#Some rough Ideas and links

##Some links to the API Docs:

* https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/
* https://developer.github.com/v3/

*Idea: Can projects add a file and then we search github to find all projects with that exact file? kinda like a Unique ID?*

Idea: openhub Is this useful?: https://www.openhub.net/p/py-pandas?ref=sample
