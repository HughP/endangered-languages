#Some rough Ideas and links

##Some links to the API Docs:

* https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/
* https://developer.github.com/v3/
* https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#custom-media-types


*Idea: Can projects add a file and then we search github to find all projects with that exact file? kinda like a Unique ID?*

Idea: openhub Is this useful?: https://www.openhub.net/p/py-pandas?ref=sample

##What are all the badges I see in Readme Files?

## It seems that We could make a stastical report
* Here is an example of a stastical report on US Gov Code: http://gsa.github.io/github-federal-stats/index.html
* Here is something on Jekel:http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/
* Here is how to use Metadata on Github: https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/
